# Auth Microservice

Since features like login and register are often used in web apps this microservice abstracts basic authentication and authorization features.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/filipegeric/auth-microservice
cd auth-microservice
cp .env.example .env
npm i
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
